## Things I want to learn

I'm not a Vim enthusiast but would like to learn how to use it better, there is
a cool resource for practicing it here:
[https://vim-racer.com/](https://vim-racer.com/). I want to also get better with
Typescript, and statically typed languages in general. Go looks interesting, I'd
like to learn that at some point. And Rust. And C++. There are so many things I
want to learn. I need to learn some things better for developing for the web.
Such as data storage; learning different types of databases and when to use
which type. I also need to learn design patterns for the backend. And of course
keep improving my code quality on the frontend.

I intend to create a list of cool learning resources that I have collected, and
would like to reference in the future. I'll eventually re-write this blog post,
but I just want to put up some content for now.

I also need to update my LinkedIn profile picture, and eventually my resume with
this portfolio site.

I should add some of the interesting things I've worked on to this site. It's
kind of a mishmash of things, but I should have enough of a jumping off point
for some projects to at least create a blog post.

Some things I've worked on:

-   League of Legends match history lookup tool
-   Dynamic animations in HTML Canvas. Not sure how to present this one. My
    original intent was to create a falling sand game, but it turned into a
    fireworks display.
-   Godot Rythym game. Doesn't have to be a long post, but I should talk about
    what I contributed, and anything I learned.
-   I have a WebGL repo that I might be able to turn into a blog post.
-   Maybe write about hardware stuff? MiSter / Flipper Zero / Arduino etc.

Talk about work challenges?

-   Summarize our cost-saving practices with AWS
-   Optimizing Wordpress sites for SEO and performance
-   Maybe I can write about using AWS transcribe? I already wrote a bunch of
    words about it for Peter
-   Moving our employee time tracker to a new app

Learn new things and blog about them to reinforce learning:

-   Typescript
-   DSA learnings with Advent of Code / LeetCode
-   Javascript JIT Compiler inner workings
-   React inner workings
